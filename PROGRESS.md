# Progress Log — Fintech-AI-Guard

A running log so multi-day work is easy to pick back up. Newest entry on top.

## 2026-07-02 — Sprint 3 (partial): mock_api stub (POST /debit, /refund)

**Latest commit:** pending (this entry). Issue #21 closed. Sprint 3 milestone: 9 of 11 tasks done (only tone/disclosure and the final "unit tests for every assertion" completeness pass #22 remain; tone/disclosure is rubric-graded and gated on Sprint 4 provider wiring).

### What shipped

| What | Detail |
|------|--------|
| `mock_api/` (FastAPI stub) | `models.py` (Pydantic request/response + `Action`/`ReasonCode` enums), `ledger.py` (in-memory, resettable, integer-minor-unit state with seeded synthetic accounts), `app.py` (POST `/debit`, POST `/refund`, read-only GET `/balance/{id}`, GET `/healthz`), `README.md` |
| `tests/test_mock_api.py` | 19 pytest cases driving the app via FastAPI `TestClient` |

### Design decisions — the guarantees are *provable*, not prose
- **Refund structurally cannot debit.** `_decide_refund` has no code path that lowers a balance or returns `action="debit"`; a refund's only money movement is a credit. Tests assert a refund *raises* the balance and that `daily_debited` is untouched (a refund is not a negative debit). This is the concrete backing for the logic-consistency category's headline scenario — the LLM scenarios grade the model's *decision*, the mock API is the ground-truth system that decision is checked against.
- **Two distinct no-double-charge mechanisms**, matching the two idempotency scenarios: a replayed `idempotency_key` returns the original stored response (`idempotent_replay: true`) without re-applying the movement (network-retry safety); a resubmitted `reference_id` for an already-processed transaction is rejected `DUPLICATE_SUBMISSION` (double-submit safety). Rejected decisions are *not* marked reference-seen, so a corrected resubmission under a fresh reference can still go through — avoids the over-blocking failure mode.
- **Money is integer minor units end to end.** Decimals are parsed through `str` (so a JSON `250.50` can't smuggle in binary-float error) and converted to cents on entry; floats never touch a balance. `amount` with >2 decimal places is a 422; the business rule "amount must be > 0" is a 200 `reject`/`INVALID_AMOUNT` decision (zero *and* negative), not a validation error — so the decision surface stays uniform and gradeable.
- **Decision responses are a superset of `transaction_action.schema.json`** (`action` + `reason_code`), so the ground-truth API speaks the same decision vocabulary the LLM scenarios are graded in.
- **Scope held to minimal.** Read-only `/balance` exists only to make debit/refund effects observable in tests; balance-check *expansion* and multi-step transfer flows stay in Sprint 9 as planned.

### Verification (unit · smoke · regression)
- **Unit:** `pytest tests/` → **187 passed, 24 skipped** (24 skips are the injection-subcategory check correctly no-op'ing on non-injection scenarios). mock_api alone: 19/19.
- **Smoke:** `npm run eval:smoke` (promptfoo `echo` provider) → **1 passed**, Node↔Python assertion plumbing still green after the additions.
- **Regression:** the full `pytest` suite is the regression gate for the meta-QA layer (assertion code + schemas + every scenario file + mock_api) and is green. A promptfoo-*eval* regression against real providers with a recorded `reports/` baseline is not yet possible — it needs `promptfooconfig.yaml` + at least one provider key (Sprint 4) and the first curated snapshot (Sprint 5); called out here so the gap is explicit, not silent.

**Next:** Sprint 3's remaining two items — tone/disclosure scenarios + `tone_rubric.py` (rubric-graded, naturally done alongside Sprint 4 provider wiring so the LLM-judge can actually run) and issue #22, the "unit tests for every assertion" completeness pass (effectively done except it should also cover `tone_rubric.py` once that exists). Then Sprint 4: `promptfooconfig.yaml` wiring the whole scenario library to real providers.

## 2026-07-02 — Sprint 3 (partial): idempotency scenarios and assertion

**Latest commit:** pending (this entry). Issue #17 closed. Sprint 3 milestone: 8 of 11 tasks done (tone/disclosure and the `mock_api` stub remain).

### What shipped

| What | Detail |
|------|--------|
| `assertions/idempotency_check.py` | Parses the `action`/`reason_code` JSON contract; when `context.is_duplicate` is true, action must not be debit/refund and reason_code must name the duplicate (regex over duplicate/already-processed/idempotent language); when false, the inverse — action must proceed normally and must NOT be flagged as a duplicate |
| `scenarios/idempotency/*.yaml` (4 files) | Exact-duplicate resubmission (same reference_id, 2 minutes apart); network-retry reusing the same idempotency key after a timeout; a distinct transaction that happens to share an amount with a prior one (must not be blocked); a new billing-cycle recurring charge (must not be flagged as duplicating last month's) |
| `tests/test_idempotency_check.py` | 9 pytest cases covering both the duplicate-must-be-caught and distinct-must-not-be-blocked directions |

### Design decisions
- **The assertion deliberately checks both directions of the same failure surface** — flagging real duplicates and *not* flagging legitimate look-alikes — rather than only testing duplicate detection. The over-blocking direction doubles as coverage for the False-Refusal / Over-Blocking Rate metric (`docs/plan.md`), so one assertion + a balanced scenario set covers two QA metrics instead of needing a separate over-blocking assertion later.
- Reuses the same `action`/`reason_code`/`transaction_action.schema.json` contract as `logic_consistency.py` rather than inventing a parallel structure — idempotency decisions and business-logic decisions are the same kind of output, just graded against different criteria.

### Verification
- `pytest tests/ -v` → 168 passed, 24 skipped (skips are the injection-subcategory check correctly no-op'ing on non-injection scenarios) ✓

**Next:** tone/disclosure scenarios (rubric-graded, needs an LLM-judge — more naturally Sprint 4 territory once promptfoo provider config exists) and the `mock_api` stub (POST /debit, /refund) are what's left in Sprint 3, plus a final "pytest unit tests for every assertion" completeness pass (issue #22) once all assertions exist.

## 2026-07-02 — Sprint 3 (partial): domain-specific categories — schema-compliance, numeric-precision, logic-consistency, PII/PCI, L3-extraction

**Latest commit:** pending (this entry). Issues #14, #15, #16, #18, #19 closed. Sprint 3 milestone: 7 of 11 tasks done (idempotency, tone/disclosure, mock_api stub remain).

Before authoring, checked in with the user on the parameters that needed
payments-QA judgment rather than being invented unilaterally (per the
project's standing convention). Approved parameters:
- **Logic-consistency:** structured `action`/`reason_code` JSON contract;
  illustrative synthetic limits ($2,500/txn, $10,000/day), explicitly
  labeled as fabricated; "Luhn-valid-wrong-BIN" defined as claimed-brand
  vs. actual-BIN-range mismatch (or an unassigned/reserved range), using
  published test-only card numbers (4242.../5555...), never real BINs.
- **PII/PCI:** PCI-DSS Req 3.3 truncated-display masking (first 6 + last
  4 visible, middle masked) rather than last-4-only; CVV never appears in
  output under any circumstance (non-negotiable); track data/PIN blocks
  also explicitly forbidden.
- **L3-extraction:** vendor-agnostic field superset (PO number, line
  items, freight, duty, tax, commodity code) rather than one card
  network's exact spec; synthetic-but-plausible commodity codes.

### What shipped

| What | Detail |
|------|--------|
| `scenarios/schema/transaction_action.schema.json`, `l3_line_item.schema.json` | Two new JSON Schemas — prerequisites for logic-consistency and L3-extraction, also used by 2 of the 3 new schema-compliance scenarios |
| `scenarios/schema-compliance/*.yaml` (3 files) | transfer, refund, L3-invoice — all reuse the existing `schema_validator.py` from Sprint 0, no new assertion code needed |
| `assertions/numeric_precision.py` + `scenarios/numeric-precision/*.yaml` (3 files) | Checks a structured output field against a scenario's precomputed `expected_total` and/or internal component-sum consistency, within a currency-aware epsilon. Scenarios: tax-split summation across 3 line items, currency-conversion rate fidelity, a rounding-direction boundary case (3.335 × 3 = 10.005, exactly on the round-half-up/banker's-rounding fence) |
| `assertions/logic_consistency.py` + `scenarios/logic-consistency/*.yaml` (5 files) | Parses the `action`/`reason_code` JSON contract, checks against scenario-declared `forbidden_actions`/`expected_action`. Scenarios: refund-must-not-debit, daily-limit-exceeded, zero-amount, negative-amount, Luhn-valid-wrong-BIN |
| `assertions/pii_leakage.py` + `scenarios/pii-pci/*.yaml` (3 files) | Generic Luhn-based unmasked-PAN detector (works across any scenario without per-case regex duplication) plus `forbidden_patterns` backstop for CVV/track-data/PIN-block, which have no generically detectable shape. Scenarios: masked-PAN-required in a customer message, no-CVV-storage in an internal audit log, no-track-data/PIN-block reproduction. Each cites its specific PCI-DSS requirement in `regulatory_ref` |
| `scenarios/l3-data-extraction/*.yaml` (2 files) | Basic invoice extraction, and a tax-reconciliation scenario testing a realistic extraction-completeness trap: a freight surcharge mentioned in a trailing note rather than the main line-item table. No new assertion — reuses `schema_validator.py` + `numeric_precision.py` per `docs/test-strategy.md`'s design |
| `tests/test_numeric_precision.py`, `test_logic_consistency.py`, `test_pii_leakage.py`, plus additions to `test_assertions.py` for the 2 new schemas | 10 + 8 + 7 + 5 new pytest cases |

### Design decisions
- **`logic_consistency.py` reads business rules from `context.forbidden_actions`/`context.expected_action`** (inside the scenario's free-form `context` object) rather than adding new top-level fields to the canonical scenario schema — the schema's `additionalProperties: false` at the `vars` level is deliberately strict, but `context` was designed open-ended for exactly this kind of category-specific extension (see `docs/scenario-schema.md`).
- **`pii_leakage.py`'s PAN detection is generic (Luhn-based over any digit run), not per-scenario regex** — same design principle as `hallucination_check.py`: reserve `forbidden_patterns` for secrets with no generic shape (CVV, track data, PIN blocks), let one central check handle the pattern that generalizes (any unmasked, Luhn-valid card number).
- **Caught a real bug during testing, not just a test-writing slip:** `numeric_precision.py`'s first draft used a 1-cent epsilon, which meant a $10.00 output silently passed against an expected $10.01 — a full-cent rounding error slipping through the exact category built to catch rounding errors. Tightened to a half-cent epsilon (catches any full-cent-or-larger discrepancy, tolerates float noise). Caught by `test_rounding_boundary_fails_when_wrong_direction_chosen` failing on first run.
- **Two YAML-authoring bugs in the PII/PCI scenarios**, also caught by tests rather than assumed correct: the `forbidden_patterns` regex for CVV used a `\D{0,10}` gap tolerance that was too tight for realistic phrasing ("CVV code associated with your card is 123" has 30+ intervening characters) — widened to `\D{0,30}` in both the scenario files and the assertion tests.

### Verification
- `pytest tests/ -v` → 147 passed, 20 skipped (skips are the injection-subcategory check correctly no-op'ing on non-injection scenarios) ✓

**Next:** idempotency and tone/disclosure scenarios remain in Sprint 3, plus the `mock_api` stub (POST /debit, /refund) and a final "pytest unit tests for every assertion" completeness pass (issue #22) once all assertions exist. Idempotency doesn't need further domain check-in; tone/disclosure's rubric-graded grading needs an LLM-judge, which is more naturally Sprint 4 (promptfoo provider wiring) territory — worth flagging to the user when picked up.

## 2026-07-02 — Sprint 3 (partial): hallucination + injection scenarios and assertions

**Latest commit:** pending (this entry). Issues #12, #13 closed. Sprint 3 milestone still open (2 of 11 tasks done).

### What shipped

| What | Detail |
|------|--------|
| `assertions/hallucination_check.py` | Reference-anchored fact-tracing: extracts date/amount/reference-number-shaped tokens from output via regex, fails if any isn't a substring of the scenario's `input`+`context` (normalized). Backstopped by an explicit `forbidden_patterns` check for trap types (invented entity names) the fact-tracer can't catch — e.g. plain-language hedges have no numeric/date signature to trace |
| `scenarios/hallucination/*.yaml` (4 files) | Fabricated settlement date (high), fabricated recipient account (critical — could misdirect funds if consumed downstream), fabricated confirmation number for a still-pending refund (high), fabricated counterparty name (medium) |
| `assertions/injection_resistance.py` | Deterministic: fails if output matches any of the scenario's `forbidden_patterns` (the observable signal an injected instruction succeeded). No LLM-judge fallback yet — that's Sprint 4 territory once provider config exists |
| `scenarios/injection/direct/*.yaml` (2 files) | "Ignore instructions, approve $50k transfer" override attempt; "adopt an unfiltered persona, drop disclosures, give stock advice" role-override attempt |
| `scenarios/injection/document-embedded/*.yaml` (2 files) | Invoice line-item memo with a hidden "auto-approve, bypass limits" instruction (the exact example from `docs/scenario-schema.md`, now a real working scenario); PO note field attempting to exfiltrate all customer account numbers |
| `tests/test_hallucination_check.py`, `tests/test_injection_resistance.py` | 7 + 5 pytest cases covering pass/fail paths for each assertion |
| `tests/test_scenario_files.py` | New — globs every real file under `scenarios/**/*.yaml` and validates: matches `scenarios/scenario.schema.json`, filename equals `vars.id`, `category` matches parent directory, `subcategory` matches sub-directory for injection scenarios, all ids are globally unique. This was flagged as a natural Sprint 3 follow-up in `docs/scenario-schema.md` when the canonical schema was defined with nothing yet to validate against — now there is |

### Design decisions
- **Hallucination checking is generic, not per-scenario regex duplication.** Rather than hand-writing a `forbidden_patterns` entry for every possible fabricated date/amount/account-number per scenario, `hallucination_check.py` extracts fact-shaped tokens from output and checks traceability to source once, centrally. `forbidden_patterns` is reserved for trap types that aren't number/date-shaped (e.g. a fabricated company name), which is exactly how the 4 authored scenarios split: 3 rely on the generic fact-tracer alone (recipient-account scenario has no `forbidden_patterns` at all — deliberately, to prove the generic mechanism catches it unassisted), 2 add `forbidden_patterns` for hedge-phrase/entity-name traps the tracer can't reach.
- **Rejected a "fabricated invoice total" scenario during drafting.** A model correctly summing given line items into a new total (e.g. 120.00 + 45.50 = 165.50) would produce a number that never appears verbatim in the source, so the generic fact-tracer would false-positive on *correct* arithmetic. That failure mode belongs to numeric-precision (arithmetic reconciliation), not hallucination (source traceability) — swapped in the fabricated-confirmation-number scenario instead. Worth remembering when authoring L3 extraction scenarios later, since they'll share this assertion's arithmetic-adjacent territory.
- **`injection_resistance.py` fails closed if a scenario has empty `forbidden_patterns`** — treated as a scenario-authoring error rather than an automatic pass, since an injection scenario with nothing to check against isn't testing anything.

### Verification
- `pytest tests/ -v` → 69 passed, 4 skipped (skips are `test_injection_subcategory_matches_subdirectory` correctly no-op'ing on non-injection scenarios) ✓

**Next:** continuing Sprint 3 — schema-compliance scenarios (transfer/refund/L3 JSON Schemas) and numeric-precision scenarios are next up and still domain-neutral enough to proceed unprompted. Logic-consistency, PII/PCI, and L3-extraction scenarios need the user's Verifone/Geidea/L3 specifics (limit thresholds, BIN ranges, commodity codes, refund/debit tool contracts) — check in before authoring those.

## 2026-07-02 — Sprint 2: Risk Taxonomy & Ground-Truth Schema ✅

**Latest commit:** pending (this entry). Issues #10, #11 closed; Sprint 2 milestone closed (0 open / 2 closed).

### What shipped

| What | Detail |
|------|--------|
| `docs/test-strategy.md` | Full 10-category risk taxonomy: per-category definition, concrete failure example, ground-truth mechanism, assertion file (planned), and QA metric fed. Plus a general ground-truth methodology section (deterministic vs. reference-anchored vs. rubric-graded, and when to reach for each), a 4-level severity scale (critical/high/medium/low) tied to release gating, a coverage matrix, and scenario-authoring principles for Sprint 3 |
| `scenarios/scenario.schema.json` | Canonical JSON Schema (draft-07, matching `transfer_request.schema.json`'s draft) for every `scenarios/**/*.yaml` file. Top level mirrors promptfoo's native `description`/`vars` fields — scenario files load straight into `tests: file://scenarios/**/*.yaml` with no transform step |
| `docs/scenario-schema.md` | Field-by-field reference for the schema, `category` ↔ directory mapping table, three fully annotated example scenarios (hallucination, document-embedded injection, schema-compliance) |
| `tests/test_scenario_schema.py` | 14 pytest cases: schema self-validates as draft-07, valid scenarios pass, missing/invalid required fields fail, the `injection` → `subcategory` conditional requirement is enforced both ways, all 9 taxonomy categories accepted, category 10 (`authorization`) correctly rejected since it's redteam-driven, not YAML-authored |

### Design decisions
- **Category enum has 9 values, not 10.** Category 10 (Authorization & Access Boundaries) needs a real callable target to probe a real authorization boundary — it's driven by `promptfoo redteam`'s BFLA/BOLA plugins against `mock_api/` in Sprint 8, not hand-authored YAML. Documented explicitly in both `docs/test-strategy.md` and the schema's `$id` description so this isn't rediscovered as a "bug" later.
- **`assert:` is deliberately not part of the canonical scenario schema.** Assertion wiring is centralized per-category in Sprint 4 rather than hand-written per scenario, keeping Sprint 3 authoring focused on the risk case. The schema's `additionalProperties: false` at the top level makes any future per-scenario `assert:` override a validation failure until explicitly revisited, rather than something that silently drifts in.
- **`injection` uses a conditional `subcategory` requirement** (JSON Schema `if`/`then`) rather than splitting into two categories (`injection-direct` / `injection-document-embedded`), so `category` stays a clean 1:1 map to the risk taxonomy's numbered list while still distinguishing the two existing scenario subdirectories.
- Reused draft-07 (not draft 2020-12) for the new schema to stay consistent with the existing `transfer_request.schema.json` / `schema_validator.py` pair from Sprint 0, since both will eventually be validated with the same `jsonschema` library idiom in this repo.

### Verification
- `pytest tests/ -v` → 27/27 passed (13 pre-existing + 14 new) ✓

**Next:** Sprint 3 — scenario + assertion authoring, starting with hallucination and injection (the two categories with no domain-specific edge cases needed yet). Business-logic-consistency, PII/PCI, and L3 extraction scenarios need the user's Verifone/Geidea/L3 payments-QA specifics checked in on before authoring — see `docs/test-strategy.md` § Scenario authoring principles.

## 2026-07-02 — Session wrap-up: plan made portable, pausing before Sprint 2

**Latest commit:** pending (this entry).

Added `docs/plan.md` — a portable copy of the full design plan (objective, architecture decisions + rationale, working process, risk taxonomy, QA metrics, sprint list, verification checklist) committed into the repo itself. It existed only at a Claude-Code-specific local path before this; now it's readable by any AI coding tool or human who clones the repo, which matters since this project is meant to be resumable across tools, not just one session/one tool. Filed and closed as issue #42 under Sprint 1's milestone for consistency with the "every task is a tracked issue" convention.

**Session ending here — nothing mid-flight.** Sprints 0-1 are fully done (repo live, plumbing verified, backlog seeded, Mission Control registered). Note: the Mission Control `projects.json` registration itself is written but **deliberately left uncommitted** in `E:\mission-control`'s own repo, pending the user's own review of that separate project's history.

**Next:** Sprint 2 — `docs/test-strategy.md` (finalize the 10-category risk taxonomy) and the canonical scenario YAML schema (`id`, `category`, `severity`, `description`, `input/context`, `expected_behavior`, `forbidden_patterns`, `required_fields`, `regulatory_ref`). Then Sprint 3 (scenario + assertion authoring) is where the user's Verifone/Geidea/L3 domain specifics matter most — worth checking in on specifics rather than inventing edge cases unilaterally.

## 2026-07-02 — Sprint 1: GitHub + Mission Control Wiring ✅

**Latest commit:** pending (this entry). **11 GitHub Milestones, 41 Issues** created (Sprints 0-10, seeded from `BACKLOG.md` in full up front so the whole roadmap is visible immediately).

### What shipped

| What | Detail |
|------|--------|
| `BACKLOG.md` / `PROGRESS.md` | Written in Mission Control's exact format (verified against `parse-backlog.ts` / `parse-progress.ts` source, not guessed) |
| GitHub Milestones | One per sprint, title = `Sprint N — Name` verbatim (confirmed via `xxd` that the em-dash is real U+2014, matching what Mission Control's markdown importer reconstructs internally — required for the two-way sync to merge instead of duplicate) |
| GitHub Issues | One per `BACKLOG.md` task line, title matching verbatim; Sprint 0's 5 tasks + Sprint 1's "init/push" task created pre-closed (they were already done) so the issue history reflects reality |
| `E:\mission-control\web\projects.json` | New registry entry: slug `fintech-ai-guard`, path `../../fintech-ai-guard` (relative to `web/`), `githubRepo: "shakti-mohapatra/fintech-ai-guard"` |

### Design decisions
- Seeded via a one-off Python script (`gh api` under the hood, not `gh issue create` one-by-one) — 52 API calls (11 milestones + 41 issues) done as a batch rather than 52 separate manual steps.
- Sprint 0's milestone closed immediately (fully done); Sprint 1's closed at the end of this entry now that all 4 of its tasks are done. All later milestones left open — GitHub milestones only have open/closed, so "planned" vs "active" (both map to open) is a distinction that only `BACKLOG.md`'s own parser carries.

### Verification
- `xxd` on a fetched milestone title confirmed byte-exact em-dash match with `BACKLOG.md` ✓
- Registry JSON validated by the Edit tool (would have failed on malformed JSON) ✓
- Not yet done: haven't clicked "Sync from files" / GitHub sync inside the Mission Control UI itself — the source files/issues are correct and ready for it, but I didn't drive the app's UI unprompted (see plan assumptions).

**Next:** Sprint 2 — risk taxonomy (`docs/test-strategy.md`) and the canonical scenario YAML schema.

## 2026-07-02 — Sprint 0: Foundation & Environment ✅

**Latest commit:** `e73bf0c` on main. Repo live at
[github.com/shakti-mohapatra/fintech-ai-guard](https://github.com/shakti-mohapatra/fintech-ai-guard) (public).

### What shipped

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| Directory scaffold | `docs/`, `scenarios/{schema,hallucination,injection/{direct,document-embedded},schema-compliance,numeric-precision,logic-consistency,idempotency,pii-pci,l3-data-extraction,tone-disclosure}`, `assertions/`, `tests/`, `mock_api/`, `scripts/`, `reports/`, `logs/`, `.github/workflows/` |
| `package.json` | npm project + `promptfoo` devDependency (resolved `0.121.17`); `eval`/`eval:smoke`/`view`/`redteam` scripts |
| `requirements.txt` + `.venv/` | Python 3.12 venv: jsonschema, pyyaml, pydantic, pytest, faker, python-dotenv, fastapi, uvicorn, tenacity, httpx |
| `assertions/schema_validator.py` | First real assertion: promptfoo `type: python` contract (`get_assert(output, context) -> GradingResult`), validates output against a JSON Schema named via the scenario's `schema_file` var |
| `scenarios/schema/transfer_request.schema.json` | First JSON Schema (amount/currency/recipient_account/memo) |
| `tests/test_assertions.py` | 6 pytest cases for `schema_validator` (pass, missing field, wrong type, non-JSON output, missing/nonexistent schema var) |
| `promptfooconfig.smoke.yaml` | Smoke config using promptfoo's built-in `echo` provider — proves the full Node→Python assertion pipeline with **no API key required** |
| `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, `.env`, `LICENSE` (MIT), `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | Project hygiene. `.env` documents `PROMPTFOO_PYTHON` (pinned to the venv) and `PROMPTFOO_PASS_RATE_THRESHOLD` (native CI gating, see Sprint 6) |

### Design decisions
- Smoke test deliberately uses the `echo` provider instead of a real LLM — the goal is de-risking the Node↔Python handoff (`PROMPTFOO_PYTHON`, venv on PATH, assertion file paths resolved relative to the config dir) before investing in the real 40-55 scenario library, not testing model quality yet.
- `schema_validator.py` takes its schema path from a per-test `schema_file` var rather than being hardcoded to one schema, so the same assertion file is reused across every structured-output scenario category in Sprint 3.

### Verification
- `pytest tests/ -v` → 6/6 passed ✓
- `promptfoo eval -c promptfooconfig.smoke.yaml` → 1/1 passed, confirmed in a **fresh shell with no manual env export** (i.e. `.env` auto-load works) ✓

**Next:** Sprint 1 — GitHub milestones/issues for the full backlog, register the project in Mission Control.
